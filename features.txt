To make your distributed file system more advanced, complex, and closer to production-grade, consider implementing the following features:

1. Replication & Fault Tolerance
Replication Factor: Allow configurable replication (e.g., each chunk is stored on N nodes).
Node Failure Detection: Implement heartbeat or health checks to detect failed nodes.
Automatic Re-replication: When a node fails, automatically replicate lost chunks to healthy nodes.
2. Dynamic Node Management
Node Registration/Deregistration: Allow nodes to join/leave the cluster dynamically.
Consistent Hashing: Use consistent hashing for balanced chunk placement and minimal data movement on node changes.
3. Metadata Persistence
Persistent Metadata Store: Store metadata (file-chunk mapping, chunk-node mapping) in a persistent database (e.g., SQLite, etcd, or a distributed KV store) to survive master restarts.
4. Scalability
Sharded or Distributed Master: Avoid single master bottleneck by sharding metadata or using a distributed consensus protocol (e.g., Raft, Paxos).
Horizontal Scaling: Support adding/removing storage nodes without downtime.
5. Security
Authentication & Authorization: Secure communication between client, master, and nodes (e.g., TLS, API keys).
Access Control: Implement file/chunk-level permissions.
. Data Integrity
Checksums: Store and verify checksums for each chunk to detect corruption.
Versioning: Support chunk/file versioning for consistency and rollback.
7. Advanced Client Features
Parallel Upload/Download: Allow clients to upload/download chunks in parallel for better performance.
Partial Reads/Writes: Support reading/writing parts of files (not just whole chunks).
8. Monitoring & Observability
Metrics & Logging: Expose metrics (Prometheus, Grafana) and structured logs for monitoring.
Admin APIs: Provide APIs for inspecting system state, chunk locations, node health, etc.
9. Garbage Collection
Orphaned Chunk Cleanup: Periodically remove chunks that are no longer referenced by any file.
10. User-Friendly APIs
REST/gRPC API: Provide a RESTful or gRPC API for clients, not just raw TCP.
